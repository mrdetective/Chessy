## Structure

- The frontend of the website is built using HTML, CSS, and  - JavaScript.
- HTML is used for structuring the webpage, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
- All chess moves are handled and executed using JavaScript. This includes moves by the user and the moves generated by the Stockfish chess engine

### Structure of the game against Stocfish:

- Flask, a Python web framework, is used to create a backend server for handling Stockfish integration.
- The frontend JavaScript code computes the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) notation based on the current configuration of the chessboard.
- FEN notation is a standard way to describe a particular board position in chess.
- When the user makes a move, JavaScript computes the FEN notation reflecting the new board position.
- After computing the FEN notation, the frontend sends an API request to the Flask server.
- The request includes two parameters: the FEN notation and the difficulty level selected by the user (easy, medium, or hard)
- It then uses a Python library for Stockfish to analyze the position.
- The analysis is tailored according to the user-selected difficulty level (e.g., easy - 500 Elo, medium - 1500 Elo, hard - 2500 Elo).
- Stockfish's analysis result is sent back as a response from the Flask server to the frontend.
- The response typically contains the recommended move or the best move according to the chosen difficulty level.
- The frontend JavaScript processes the move and handles various aspects of chess, such as pawn promotion and castling, based on the rules of the game.
- The frontend updates the chessboard display with the new move.

### Structure of the game in Muliplayer Mode:

- Socket.io, a JavaScript library, is used to establish real-time bidirectional communication between the users and the server.It allows users to send and receive chess moves instantly.
- Node.js is employed as the server-side runtime environment for the application.
- WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology is incorporated to enable video and audio communication between users.
- Users can see and hear each other during the game, enhancing the multiplayer experience.
- Agora.io is utilized as a signaling server to establish WebRTC connections between users. It helps with the initial setup and negotiation required for WebRTC communication.
- To maintain a synchronized game state between all players, the server broadcasts the game status, including the board configuration, to all connected clients.
- Users can make chess moves, see each other's video feeds, and hear audio communication simultaneously.
- The real-time nature of the system allows for interactive and engaging multiplayer chess matches.
